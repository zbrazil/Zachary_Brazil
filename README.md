First project uploaded (Digit Recognizer) was my first dive into Convolutional Neural Networks. With Kaggle showing our model had a 98.5% accuracy rate, it really displayed how well neural networks function and accurate they can be compared to other machine learning algorithms.

The second project (NFL Final Dataset) was a project for a data wrangling class. The first part of the notebook is simple wrangling techniques through Pandas but towards the bottom is a lot of concatenating of multiple dataframes, and manipulation of certain columns to get values for metrics not originally provided in the dataset. Plots through matplotlib are shown throughout the notebook along with examples of Pandas versatility.
